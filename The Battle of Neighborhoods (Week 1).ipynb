This project is for those people who are looking for better neighborhoods and facilities such as a school for their children, safety, or maybe an easy excess for transportation and maybe some tired of poor basic resources and finding a better place with better resources.\n\nThis project aims to create an analysis of features for people migrating to Scarborough to search the best neighborhood as a comparative analysis between neighborhoods. The features include median housing price and better school according to ratings, crime rates of that particular area, road connectivity, weather conditions, good management for an emergency, water resources both fresh and wastewater, and excrement conveyed in sewers and recreational facilities.\n\nIt will help people to get the awareness of the area and neighborhood before moving to a new city, state, country or place for their work or to start a new fresh life"

Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 500.\n\n* **Clustering Approach:**\nTo compare the similarities of two cities, we decided to explore neighborhoods, segment them, and group them into clusters to find similar neighborhoods in a big city like New York and Toronto. To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm\n\n*  **Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:**\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; 1.Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.JSON: Library to handle JSON files.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; 5.XML: To separate data from presentation and XML stores data in plain text format.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; 6.Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; 7.Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; 8.Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.\n"
